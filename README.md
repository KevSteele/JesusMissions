Here's a breakdown of your considerations and some recommendations:

1. Tech Stack (MERN)
    Build both web and mobile versions using React Native.
    Have a Node.js backend to handle API requests, future authentication, and caching.
    Leverage MongoDB for future scalability when you need to store user data, track content, or handle session management.
    However, since you won't be storing much data at this stage and the primary need is for serving content and handling a map, you might not need the full MERN stack right away. Consider starting with just React Native (for front-end) and Node.js (for backend), and adding MongoDB later if you need more complex data storage.

2. Free or Cheap CMS Platforms
    To manage your video and text content without code changes, you can use a headless CMS. Some good options include:

    Strapi: Open-source and free, with self-hosting. It's easy to set up and integrates well with React Native.
    Contentful: Free for small projects, has good documentation, and supports RESTful API calls.
    These platforms will allow you to update content through a web interface and deliver it via APIs, making your app dynamic without needing code changes.

3. Using Vite for Project Setup
    Expo simplifies setting up a React Native environment and managing dependencies. Itâ€™s great for fast prototyping.

4. Session Management and Caching
    For caching data from the Joshua Project API and managing sessions:
        Consider using a combination of local storage (like AsyncStorage for React Native) for caching small amounts of data on the client-side.
        Use a lightweight caching library like React Query or SWR to handle API caching. This would avoid unnecessary API calls and improve app performance.

5. Use Docker for Dependency Management
    Use Docker from the outset to containerize your React Native app, backend services (like Strapi or any future Node.js API), and any other components.
    This will simplify future migrations, keep environments consistent, and provide flexibility in choosing or switching hosting platforms.

6. Hosting
    Begin with Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify:
        Heroku: Good for backend services and hosting a headless CMS like Strapi. Supports easy scaling and is beginner-friendly.
        Vercel: Excellent for frontend deployments (React Native web) and serverless functions. Best if your app's backend is light.
        Netlify: Great for static site deployments and serverless functions, but might not be ideal if you have more dynamic backend needs.
    Plan for Future Migration to a Cloud Provider:
        As your content grows, especially with video streaming or a full-length feature film, consider migrating to a cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) for better scalability, storage, and performance.

    Recommendations Summary:
    Start with React Native (Expo or CLI) and Node.js for a lightweight and flexible stack.
    Integrate a headless CMS like Strapi, Contentful, or Sanity for dynamic content management.
    Use React Query or SWR for caching API data efficiently.
    Consider using Docker if you foresee complex deployments or want to standardize the development environment.
    This setup will keep your app light, flexible, and scalable for future growth. Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any specific aspect!
